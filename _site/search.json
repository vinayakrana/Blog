    "text": "📝 Why I Write\nThe best way to understand something deeply is to explain it simply. That’s why I write. Not just to teach, but to learn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧠 Beyond Code\n\n\n\nSure, LLMs can write functions.\nBut the real work is about the intuition, trade-offs, and aha! moments behind every decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Learning Out Loud\n\n\n\nIf it challenged me, it’s worth writing down.\nBecause someone else is probably stuck in the same place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧭 Not Just Tutorials\n\n\n\nI don’t post just what works.\nI post what confused me, what finally made sense, and how I got there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔧 From Confusion to Clarity\n\n\n\nEach post captures: - A mental model that clicked\n- A mistake that taught me more than success\n- A question that made me dig deeper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎯 My Rule of Thumb\nIf I had to Google it more than twice,\nit deserves a permanent home — here."
