## 👋 Hey, I’m Vinayak

I’m an MTech AI student at IIT Gandhinagar, where I turn real-world mess into stories that models can learn from.

I'm an active member of the [Sustainability Lab](https://sustainability-lab.github.io/) led by [Prof. Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/), where we work on using machine learning to build smarter, greener systems that can actually make a difference on the ground.


## 📝 Why I Write

The best way to understand something deeply is to explain it simply.
That’s why I write. Not just to teach, but to learn.

### 🧠 Beyond Code  
Sure, LLMs can write functions.  
But the *real work* is about the **intuition**, **trade-offs**, and **aha! moments** behind every decision.

### 🔍 Learning Out Loud  
If it challenged me, it’s worth writing down.  
Because someone else is probably stuck in the same place.

### 🧭 Not Just Tutorials  
I don’t post just what works.  
I post what confused me, what finally made sense, and how I *got there*.

### 🔧 From Confusion to Clarity  
Each post captures:
- A mental model that clicked  
- A mistake that taught me more than success  
- A question that made me dig deeper

### 🎯 My Rule of Thumb  
If I had to Google it more than twice,  
it deserves a permanent home — here.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

::: columns

#### 🔍 Model Insights  
Architectures, uncertainty, and training dynamics — broken down and explained.

#### 🧠 Visual Stories  
Animations, heatmaps, and sketches that help you "see" the concept.

:::

::: column

#### ⚙️ Tools in Practice  
FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, and how I use them in real workflows.

#### 🌱 Learning Projects  
From spatial prediction experiments to personal ML tooling, where theory meets practice.

## 🎯 What I Believe

::: callout
**Clarity > Complexity**  
Great ideas don’t need jargon. If it’s complex, I try to make it simple.
:::

::: callout
**Learn in Public**  
If I’m struggling with something, I know someone else probably is too.
:::

::: callout
**Build with Intent**  
Good engineering starts with asking the right questions. (Btw there are no wrong questions)
